README file for ENPM661 Project 2 for Julia Kim

Code file name: dijkstra_julia_kim.py
Dependencies: numpy, cv2, time
Instructions:
    1. Run the python script called "dijkstra_julia_kim.py"
    2. Input the start state when prompted, as two integers separated by a comma. Then hit enter. Example: 10,10
    3. Input the goal state when prompted, as two integers separated by a comma. Then hit enter. Example: 200,10
    4. The script may run for up to 30 minutes, depending how far apart the inputs are.
    5. When finished, the script will output a message indicating that it is complete and showing the final state it calculated. It will also show the time it took to run, in seconds.
    6. The video file will be saved in the folder the script is running out of, with the name "proj2_video_julia_kim.mp4"
    7. Open the folder and play the video to see the visualization of the search algorithm and final path.
